## Piano Sheet Music Note Name Reader

This project provides a Python script that automatically detects note positions in scanned or photographed piano sheet music and converts them into corresponding note names (e.g., C, D, E, F, G, A, B).  
It currently assumes a treble clef and a C major key for simplicity.
